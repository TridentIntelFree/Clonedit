# Making music with this app, if you are an agent

Start with two calls: `howto()` and `review()`. Everything below is what
they return, in prose, and why.

    jbh_howto     the order to work in, and the traps
    jbh_review    every check at once, before a bounce

Both are in the MCP server (`mcp/server.mjs`) and on `window.JBH`.

## Why this file exists

The app has seventeen analysers. A finished track was bounced here using
six of them, and the three that would have caught what the listener
complained about — `loudness`, `translate`, `spectrum` — were among the
eleven that were not run. The listener's verdict was "the bass isn't
clear, the bells are louder than you expect". `loudness()` had those
bells at +14 to +22 dB above their own energy. `translate()` had the
bass problem and named its fix in one sentence.

Nothing was missing from the app. What was missing was any guarantee
that the checks get run. Choosing them by hand is where results stop
being repeatable, which is why `review()` runs all of them and reports
which ones it could not reach — a check that silently did not run reads
exactly like a check that passed.

## The order

0. Read `samples/atlas-*.json` for the pack you are about to use, or
   generate it. Choosing a sound and discovering afterwards that it
   cannot do the job is the most expensive mistake available here.
1. `instrument()` / `preset()` / `sound()` to build the players, then
   `pad()` for each one.
2. `pattern()` + `batch()` to write. `note()` for pitched lines,
   `step()` for everything else.
3. `reference(url)` with a finished mix you want to sound like. **Before**
   judging anything — without it, tonal balance is not checked at all and
   `critique()` says so.
4. `review({src:'song'})`. Fix what it names, in the order it names them.
   Run it again.
5. `render({loudness:true})` across a few `mTrim` values, choose by
   measurement, then bounce. Make sure the ladder BRACKETS your target:
   a denser arrangement is far hotter than a sparse one, and a ladder
   whose quietest rung is already too loud fails every gate and writes
   no file.

## There is no correct loudness

Every track bounced in this repo was aimed at about −11.5 LUFS, as
though that were the answer. It is not. Measured across 112 tracks of
one widely-admired electronic catalogue, the median is −14.5 dB with
the middle half spanning −21.2 to −8.7 — a sixteen-decibel spread, with
ambient records near −23 and dense ones near −7.6. The loudness is a
decision about the music, not a target to hit.

Pick it from what the piece is. A slow, spacious track mastered to the
same level as a dense one has had its dynamics spent on nothing, and
`dynamics()` and the crest figure will both say so.

## A reference does not have to be audio

`scripts/reference-profile.mjs <file>` measures any local audio file and
writes a profile: nine relative band levels, LUFS, crest. `reference()`
accepts that object directly, so `compare()` and `balance()` can target
a mix without the audio ever being in the repository or reachable over
the network. Measure once, keep the numbers.

This matters because the alternative is circular. Matching your own
previous bounce only propagates your own mistakes, and for a long time
that is exactly what was happening here.

## The traps

These are the ones that cost real work here. None are guessable from the
API.

**A sample pack can lie about pitch.** VSCO-2 CE names every file an
octave below what it sounds, and is not consistent with itself: one solo
violin folder uses scientific pitch and another folder of the same
instrument uses the octave-down convention. For a long time every
ensemble string, woodwind and brass in this repo played a register above
what was written — a cello section landing in viola range — and the
complaint it produced was "the strings sound unnatural". Run
`scripts/audit-pitch.mjs <manifest>` before writing on a pack. It
refuses to report until its detector passes signals whose answers are
known, because the first version of that detector read harmonics as
fundamentals and declared a correct library 12 semitones out.

**Gain is a multiplier on whatever the pad holds.** A full-scale synth at
gain 0.4 is far louder than a field recording at gain 2.0. Sources here
differ by 35 dB on disk. Stage from each sample's measured peak first and
balance by ear only after that. Setting levels by taste across mixed
sources once collapsed a whole track to kick and sub, 19 dB darker than
the track it was meant to improve on.

**Loud is not energetic.** The ear is 10–15 dB more sensitive near 3 kHz
than at 100 Hz, so bright metal and high mallets read far louder than any
RMS meter reports. `loudness()` gives perceived minus measured; anything
at +10 dB or more will jump out of the mix no matter how tidy the RMS
looks.

**Bass carries by its harmonics.** Below about 400 Hz nothing is
reproduced on a phone. A near-pure sine sub is felt on a large speaker
and simply absent on a small one, which reads as "the bass isn't clear"
rather than "the bass is quiet". `translate()` measures the loss; the fix
is a saturated parallel copy in 150–800 Hz.

**A beat can be present and inaudible.** Being on the grid is not the
same as being heard on the beat. `pulse()` weighs onsets by velocity,
pad gain *and* the level of the sample the pad holds — the first version
omitted that last term and ranked a −33 dBFS cabasa above a full-scale
kick, which inverted every number it produced.

**Read spectra normalised, never absolute.** `compare()` normalises both
sides against their own total. An absolute reading once showed a track
fixed at the top while a 16 dB hole sat at 500 Hz.

**Independent is not the same as unrelated.** Voices need shared material
as well as separate motion. `counterpoint()` measures the motion;
`motif()` measures whether anything ever comes back. A seeded random walk
passes `melody()` and `counterpoint()` and sounds like nothing at all.

## The norms are measured, not recalled

| check | measured from |
|---|---|
| `counterpoint()` | 70 Palestrina scores — 68% of moves between a pair of voices are oblique |
| `melody()` | Essen Folksong Collection, 8514 melodies |
| `motif()` | 8196 of those melodies, bucketed by length: recurrence above the same intervals reshuffled is about +28 overall, +51 for lines of 96 notes or more |

The scripts that produced them are in `scripts/study-*.py`. A random walk
scores about +7 on `motif()`; that gap is the whole point of the measure.

## Making sounds, not just judging them

Three calls have no equivalent elsewhere in the app.

`balance(opt)` solves the group levels against a loaded reference
instead of guessing them. It renders each instrument group once; after
that the fit is arithmetic, so trying a thousand combinations costs
nothing more. Five rounds of setting one track's levels by ear each
fixed one part of the spectrum and broke another — this put nine bands
inside 1.7 dB in one pass. Moves are capped at 9 dB by default, because
an unconstrained fit does not balance a mix, it deletes from one: left
alone, its cleanest route to the target took an instrument down 49 dB.
A group pinned at the cap is telling you the part or the sound is
wrong, not the level. It suggests; it does not apply.

`mutate(pad, opt)` makes variations of a sound, measures them, and
keeps the one that wins. Richard James described commissioning software
that starts with a sound, analyses it, makes randomised variations and
compares them against the original before picking the best; this is
that, with the analysers here as the fitness function. Randomising
alone is not the idea — every candidate is scored against the sound it
came from. `want` is different, similar, brighter, darker, punchier or
fuller. It restores the pad unless you pass `keep:true`.

`paint(opt)` draws a sound as a spectrum and resynthesises it, the way
MetaSynth does — the program behind the face hidden in the spectrogram
of *Equation*. An image is a spectrogram: horizontal is time, vertical
is frequency, brightness is level. Pass `rows` as a grid of levels with
the lowest frequency first, or `partials` to place tones individually,
which is how you build a bell with real inharmonic ratios rather than a
filtered oscillator pretending. Frequency maps logarithmically by
default; that is the detail people took years to work out about the
face, and it is the difference between a usable sound and everything
crowded into the top octave. What comes out is a sample on a pad, so
`chop()` and `mutate()` work on it like anything else.

`resynth(opt)` plays one sound using the pieces of another. It chops a
corpus of pads (the brain) and the target into short blocks, then
rebuilds the target from whichever brain blocks sound most like each
moment of it — the shape is the target's, the substance is the brain's.
A piano note rebuilt from vibraphone, marimba and hand chimes takes 633
blocks out of 2103 candidates. The idea is Samplebrain's, designed by
Richard James and written by Dave Griffiths; this is an independent
implementation of a published technique, not a port of their GPL code.
Matching is on spectral shape with each block normalised against its own
level, so a quiet corpus can stand in for a loud target.

## Know the pack before you write for it

`scripts/timbre-atlas.mjs <manifest>` measures every instrument in a
pack once and writes `samples/atlas-<pack>.json`: the level each sample
arrives at, which band it owns, how fast it starts, how long it rings,
and how much energy it has above 2 kHz against below 500.

Almost every mixing mistake in this repo came from not knowing one of
those numbers. Levels were staged by ear across sources that differ by
35 dB on disk. A palette was chosen for its "real top octave" and its
headline instrument — a vibraphone struck with soft mallets — turned out
to be the dullest thing in the library at 30 dB more body than air. The
bell tree was pushed to maximum gain and stayed inaudible because it
peaks at −40 dBFS and gain stops at +6. Each was discovered by
measuring, late, after a bounce had gone out, and none of them needed
discovering twice.

Read the atlas before choosing a sound for a job, rather than choosing
one and finding out afterwards that it cannot do the job.

## A warning from the tool this borrowed from

Samplebrain's own manual says, of its parameters: "we gradually added
more and more tweakable parameters until it became slightly out of
control." That is the failure mode of everything in this file. `review()`
had to be fixed twice for the same disease — it ran melodic checks on
shakers and reported one fact four times per instrument, burying four
real findings under thirty-two spurious ones.

A check that cries wolf gets ignored, and then it may as well not
exist. When adding one, ask what it will say on material where nothing
is wrong.

## Reproducing a track

`songs/*.mjs` each render one finished track end to end — build the
instruments, write the parts, run the checks, choose a master setting by
measurement, write the WAV. The bounces are gitignored; the scripts are
the artefact. `songs/README.md` says what each one was written against.
